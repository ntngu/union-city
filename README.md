A reimagining of the City of Union City's website.

## Description
I recently took a look at the City of Union City's website and made the decision to redesign it on my own accord

This would only be a pure HTML and CSS website, but this is a good opportunity to practive my CSS skills.

## Technologies
Just HTML and CSS

## Future Endeavors
I will most likely look for websites that might need a redesign and create my own version of them.

Maybe I could offer them my work. We'll see ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
